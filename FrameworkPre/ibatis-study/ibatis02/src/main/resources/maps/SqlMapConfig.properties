# This is just a simple properties file that simplifies automated configuration
# of the SQL Maps configuration file (e.g. by Ant builds or continuous

# These values can be used in any property value in the file above (e.g. ¡°${driver}¡±)
# Using a properties file such as this is completely optional.
